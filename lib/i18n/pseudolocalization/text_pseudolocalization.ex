  Form [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolocalization):

  > Pseudolocalization (or pseudo-localization) is a software testing method
  > used for testing internationalization aspects of software.
  > Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language,
  > as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application
  > are replaced with an altered version of the original language.
  >
  > These specific alterations make the original words appear readable,
  > but include the most problematic characteristics of the world's languages:
  > varying length of text or characters, language direction,
  > fit into the interface and so on.

  This pseudolocalization function does the following:

      * Replace each latin character with a slightly modified version,
        which is still legible (for example, `m → ɱ`, `j → ǰ`)

      * Add extra tilde (`~`) characters to words to make them 35% longer.
        as a rule of thumb, one should asusme that foreign language strings
        are 35% longer in other languages

      * Other characters (non-latin characters, numbers, punctuation characters, etc.)
        are not touched by the localization process

  This function doesn't respect any kind of markup that uses words,
  like HTML, XML and others.
  If you need pseudolocalization of such strings,
  you must implement your own function.
